                        Adam sandler is considered by many to be a comedical genius, especially when it comes to his envolvement in cinema both as an actor and a writer. It is definitely hard 
                        to isolate some and claim they are the greatest of his career, however after considering popularity metrics and the films success, it can be deduced that Adam Sandler struck
                        gold when developing his best three films: The Waterboy, The Weddingsinger, and 50 First Dates.

                            and recognition in the industry. Sandler created the film to be enjoyable and suited for most ages, something becoming more
                            and more rare with romantic comedies today.

                        The waterboy, released the same year as the wedding singer, focuses less on a romantic premise and gears towards its comedic value.
                        Adam sandler stars as the main character "the waterboy" and endears the audience to cheer for him on his journey 
                        to become what he aspires to be, a great football player on his team. At the same time, trying to win the heart of his love interest
                        proves difficult on his journey. This movie can forshadow that Sandler would have a hard time writing what he feels are quality
                        scripts without often including a love interest.

                        50 First dates could be widely regarded as one of sandlers most popular and iconic films of his career. The film
                        keeps its charm and its romantic appeal even at its pg-13 rating, again less and less common today. In addition to its critical acclaim,
                        it earned a whopping almost $200 milion dollars at it's release, supporting the claim to its success. A movie like this one
                        is hard to come by.
